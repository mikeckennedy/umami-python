###### configuring what to type check and where to import from

# check all files in "."
project-includes = ["."]
# exclude dotfiles
project-excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*", "**/*venv/**"]
# perform an upward search for `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and `.git/info/exclude`, and
# add those to `project-excludes` automatically
use-ignore-files = true
# import project files from "." and "umami/umami"
search-path = [".", "umami"]
# let Pyrefly try to guess your search path
disable-search-path-heuristics = false
# Query the interpreter for third-party packages (like httpx, pydantic)
# site-package-path = []  # Commented out to allow interpreter query

###### configuring your python environment

# assume we're running on linux, regardless of the actual current platform
python-platform = "linux"
# assume the Python version we're using is 3.13, without querying an interpreter
python-version = "3.13"
# is Pyrefly disallowed from querying for an interpreter to automatically determine your
# `python-platform`, `python-version`, and extra entries to `site-package-path`?
skip-interpreter-query = false
# query the default Python interpreter on your system, if installed and `python_platform`,
# `python-version`, or `site-package-path` are unset.
# python-interpreter = null # this is commented out because there are no `null` values in TOML

#### configuring your type check settings

# wildcards for which Pyrefly will unconditionally replace the import with `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = ["quart.*"]
# wildcards for which Pyrefly will replace the import with `typing.Any` if it can't be found
ignore-missing-imports = ["quart.*", "httpx", "pydantic"]
# should Pyrefly skip type checking if we find a generated file?
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = false
# should Pyrefly do a check to see if a `<library>-stubs` library also has `<library>` installed?
ignore-missing-source = false
# what should Pyrefly do when it encounters a function that is untyped?
untyped-def-behavior = "check-and-infer-return-type"
# can Pyrefly recognize ignore directives other than `# pyrefly: ignore` and `# type: ignore`
permissive-ignores = false

[errors]
# this is an empty table, meaning all errors are enabled by default

# no `[[sub-config]]` entries are included, since there are none by default
